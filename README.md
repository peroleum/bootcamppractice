# bootcamppractice
This is a practice for the CDL bootcamp!

### ideas for the bootcamp: 
* Quantum learning game 
  * maybe a quantum RPG with different classes :-P 
  * maybe you can be a wizard and level up your gate set? I dunno :-P
  * a terminal game would be best?
* Something chemical?
  * maybe an interface to do simple calculations?
